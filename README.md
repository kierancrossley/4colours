## üìÅ Documentation
- The project documentation can be seen in project-documentation.docx, which includes:
    - Analysis
    - Design
    - Development and Testing
    - Evaluation
## üí≠ How does it work?
- Start the server on the computer that will host the game
- Port 7777 must be free and port-forwarded to allow clients to connect
- Clients must be on the same computer as the server, unless they edit the Network Controller IP
- There is a max of 4 players per server
- You can preview how the game works [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSeOdIulhpY)
## üöß Issues & Improvements
- It is hard for clients to connect on external computers as they have to edit the IP in unity and then build their own client 
- The server is just a blank screen, and offers no control, configeration or information about itself
