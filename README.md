## üìÅ Documentation
- The project documentation can be seen in project-documentation.docx, which includes:
    - Analysis
    - Design
    - Development and Testing
    - Evaluation
- This documentation is for the main branch, and does not include any modifications on the dev branch 
## üí≠ How does it work?
- Start the server on the computer that will host the game
- A port-forwarded port must be free to allow clients to connect
- Each client can connect to the server using the IP and port
- There is a max of 4 players per server
- If the server is hosted on the same computer as a client, the client can use 127.0.0.1 to connect
- You can preview how the game works [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDMjlEixpSs)
## üÜï What's changed since the main branch?
- The server now has a panel, instead of a blank screen, which includes:
    - Starting, restarting, and stopping the server
    - Console to view information 
    - Server IP displayed
    - Port configeration
    - Player management
    - Forcing a game to begin
- Clients can connect to any IP without creating their own build
- Clients can rejoin the game, or leave the game, when the win screen is displayed
- Clients can return to the login page during a game
