## 💭 How does it work?
- Start the server on the computer that will host the game
- Port 7777 must be free and port-forwarded to allow clients to connect
- Each client can connect to the server using the IP and port
- There is a max of 4 players per server
- If the server is hosted on the same computer as a client, the client can use localhost:7777 to connect
